CONTRACT DOCUMENTS.\n\n1.1\n\nThe Contract Documents include this Agreement, including Amendments and Exhibits, the Exhibits described in Section 6, Change Orders, Work Directive Changes, Field Orders and the solicitation documents, including addenda. The Contract Documents are incorporated by reference and made a part of this Agreement. A copy of all Contract Documents shall be maintained by Contractor at the Project site at all times during the performance of any Work performed pursuant to this Agreement.\n\n1.2\n\nIn case of any inconsistency or conflict among the provisions of this Agreement and any other terms and conditions of any documents comprising the Contract Documents, the provisions of the Agreement shall control. Concerning the Contract Documents, the order of precedence shall be as follows: 1) the Agreement, including Amendments and Exhibits; 2) Change Orders; 3) Work Directive Changes; 4) Field Orders; 5) the Solicitation Documents, including addenda. The Contract Documents listed above represent the entire and integrated agreement between the parties hereto, and supersede prior negotiations, representations, or agreements, either written or oral.\n\nSECTION 2. SCOPE OF WORK\n\n2.1\n\nContractor agrees to furnish and pay for all management, supervision, financing, labor, materials, tools, fuel, supplies, utilities, equipment and services of every kind and type necessary to diligently, timely, and fully perform and complete in a good workmanlike manner the Scope of Work assigned to the Contractor.\n\n2.2\n\nThe basic Scope of Work to be performed under this Agreement is to provide for \"Miscellaneous Bridge, Dock, and Boat Ramp repairs and construction\" for projects within Escambia County, Florida, per the Florida Department of Transportation \"Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction\" (current edition) and the \"Escambia County Bridge, Dock, and Boat Ramp Specification Guide\" (current edition) and, unless\n\notherwise specifically excluded from any particular purchase order, all Work shall comport with County guidelines for construction, rehabilitation and renovation of projects, and local ordinances, State, and Federal laws and regulations.\n\nSECTION 3. ORDERING OF THE WORK\n\n3.1\n\nThe Contractor is one of several firms selected to perform work on same or similar terms pursuant to this Agreement. The County expressly reserves the exclusive right to assign specific purchase orders to the firm it deems best suited for the type of work to be accomplished. This Agreement does not guarantee any amount or type of work to be assigned to the Contractor.\n\n3.2\n\nWhen requested by the County, the Contractor will provide a bid to the County to perform the work requested under a scope of work, and the County shall select the most responsive bidder to perform the work.\n\n3.3\n\nThe County will issue a purchase order to the Contractor which describes the work to be provided by the Contractor and the amount of compensation to be provided by the County.\n\nSECTION 4. BONDS.\n\n4.1\n\nWhere the Contract Amount is in excess of $250,000.00 and/or at the County's request, Contractor shall provide at its expense Performance and Payment Bonds, in the form prescribed in Exhibit B, in the amount of 100% of the Contract Amount. The Performance and Payment Bonds shall be underwritten by a surety authorized to do business in the State of Florida and otherwise acceptable to County; provided; however, the surety shall be rated as \"A-\" (excellent) or better as to general policy holders rating and Class V or higher rating as to financial size category and the amount required shall not exceed 5% of the reported policy holder's surplus, all as reported in the most current Best Key Rating Guide, published by A.M. Best Company, Inc. of 75 Fulton Street, New York, New York 10038.\n\n4.2\n\nIf the surety for any bond furnished by Contractor is declared bankrupt, becomes insolvent, its right to do business is terminated in the State of Florida, or it ceases to meet the requirements imposed by the Contract Document, the Contractor shall, within five (5) calendar days thereafter, substitute another bond and surety, both of which shall be subject to the County's approval. Failure by Contractor to maintain its bonds in full force and effect at all times, including the warranty period, shall be grounds for termination of this Contract.\n\n4.3\n\nPursuant to \u00a7255.05, Florida Statutes, the Contractor shall be required to execute and record Performance and Payment Bonds. The bonds must state the name and principal business address of both the Principal and the Surety and a description of the project sufficient to identify it. (The filing costs are $10.00 for the first page and $8.50 for each remaining page).\n\nSECTION 5. CONTRACT TIME AND LIQUIDATED DAMAGES.\n\n5.1\n\nTime is of the essence in the performance of any Work assigned under this Agreement. Contractor shall commence the Work within ten (10) calendar days from the Commencement Date, established in the Notice to Proceed. No Work shall be performed at a Project site prior to the Commencement Date. Contractor shall provide 48 hours notice prior to beginning Work.\n\n5.2\n\nCounty and Contractor recognize that, since time is of the essence for this Agreement, the County will suffer financial loss if Work is not substantially completed within the time specified. Should Contractor fail to substantially complete the Work within the agreed time period, County shall be entitled to assess, as liquidated damages, but not as a penalty,\n\n$\n\n_____ for each calendar day thereafter until substantial completion is achieved. The Project shall be deemed to be substantially completed by the County on the date that the County's representative certifies in writing that the construction of the Project, or specified part thereof, is sufficiently completed in accordance with the Contract Documents, so that the Project or specified part can be utilized for the purposes for which it is intended. Along with such certification, the Architect shall compile a \"punch list\" of any remaining exceptions that do not adversely affect the use of the Project. Completion of these items will be required prior to final payment.\n\n5.3\n\nContractor hereby expressly waives and relinquishes any right which it may have to seek to characterize the above noted liquidated damages as a penalty, which the parties agree represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the County's actual damages at the time of contracting if Contractor fails to substantially complete the Work in accordance with the progress schedule.\n\n5.4\n\nWhen any period of time is referenced to by days herein, it shall be computed to exclude the first day and include the last day of such period. If the last day of any such period falls on a Saturday or Sunday or on a day made a legal holiday by the law of the applicable jurisdiction, such day shall be omitted from the computation, and the last day shall become the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.\n\nSECTION 6.

INTENT OF CONTRACT DOCUMENTS\n\n1.1.\n\nIt is the intent of the Contract Documents to describe a functionally complete project (or portion thereof) to be constructed in accordance with the Contract Documents. Any work, materials or equipment that may reasonably be inferred from the Contract Documents, as being required to produce the intended result shall be supplied whether or not specifically called for. When words, which have a well-known technical or trade meaning, are used to describe work, materials or equipment, such words shall be interpreted in accordance with that meaning. Reference to standard specifications, manuals or codes of any technical society, organization or association or to the laws or regulations of any governmental authority having jurisdiction over the Project, whether such reference be specific or by implication, shall mean the latest standard specification, manual, code, law or regulation in affect at the time the Work is performed, except as may be otherwise specifically stated herein.\n\n1.2.\n\nIf, during the performance of the Work, Contractor discovers a conflict, error or discrepancy in the Contract Documents, Contractor immediately shall report same to County and before proceeding with the Work affected thereby shall obtain an interpretation or clarification from the County.

Specifications are separated into divisions for convenience of reference only and shall not be interpreted as establishing divisions for the Work, trades, subcontracts, or extent of any part of the Work. In the event of a discrepancy between or among the drawings, specifications of other Contract Document provisions, Contractor shall be required to comply with the provision which is the more restrictive or stringent requirement upon the Contractor, as determined by the County. Unless otherwise specifically mentioned, all anchors, bolts, screws, fittings, fillers, hardware, accessories, trim and other parts required in connection with any portion of the Work to make a complete, serviceable, finished and first quality installation shall be furnished and installed as part of the Work, whether or not called for by the Contract Documents.\n\n1.4.\n\n\"\n\nEngineer\", where referenced on the drawings or in the specifications or in other related documents, shall mean the Escambia County Engineer or the designated representative thereof.\n\nSection 2. INVESTIGATION AND UTILITIES\n\n2.1.\n\nContractor shall have the sole responsibility of satisfying itself concerning the nature and location of the Work and the general and local conditions, and particularly, but without limitation, with respect to the following: those affecting transportation, access, disposal, handling and storage of materials; availability and quality of labor; water and electric power;\n\navailability and condition of roads; work area; living facilities; climatic conditions and seasons; physical conditions at the work-site and the Project area as a whole; topography and ground surface conditions; nature and quality of the surface materials to be encountered; subsurface conditions; equipment and facilities needed preliminary to and during performance of the Work; and all other costs associated with such performance. The failure of Contractor to acquaint itself with any applicable conditions shall not relieve Contractor from any of its responsibilities to perform under the Contract Documents, nor shall it be considered the basis for any claim for additional time or compensation.\n\n2.2.\n\nContractor shall locate all existing roadways, railways, drainage facilities and utility services above, upon, or under the Project site, said roadways, railways, drainage facilities and utilities being referred to in this Section 2 as the \"Utilities\". Contractor shall contact the owners of all Utilities to determine the necessity for relocating or temporarily interrupting any Utilities during the construction of the Project. Contractor shall schedule and coordinate its Work around any such relocation or temporary service interruption. Where Utilities block construction, Contractor shall aggressively pursue relocation by the Utility owners. Contractor shall immediately notify the County of any delays due to Utilities blockage and document all attempts to resolve such blockage. Contractor shall be responsible for properly shoring, supporting and protecting all Utilities at all times during the course of the Work.\n\nSection 3. SCHEDULE\n\n3.1.\n\nThe Contractor, within ten (10) calendar days after receipt of the Notice of Award, shall prepare and submit to County, for review and approval, a progress schedule for the Project (herein \"Progress Schedule\").

All monthly updates to the Progress Schedule shall be subject to the County's review and approval. Contractor shall submit the updates to the Progress Schedule with its Applications for Payment noted below. The County's review and approval of the submitted Progress Schedule updates shall be a condition precedent to the County's obligation to pay Contractor.\n\nSection 4. PROGRESS PAYMENTS\n\n4.1.\n\nPrior to submitting its first Application for Payment, Contractor shall submit to County, for its review and approval, a schedule of values based upon the Contract Price, listing the major elements of the Work and the dollar value for each element. After its approval by the County, this schedule of values shall be used as the basis for the Contractor's Applications for Payment. This schedule shall be updated and submitted along with a completed and notarized copy of the Application for Payment form attached to the Agreement as Exhibit E.\n\n4.2.\n\nPrior to submitting its first Monthly Application for Payment, Contractor shall submit to County a complete list of all its proposed subcontractors and material men, showing the work and materials involved. The first Application for Payment shall be submitted no earlier than thirty (30) days after Commencement Date.\n\n4.3.\n\nIf payment is requested on the basis of materials and equipment not incorporated into the Project, but delivered and suitably stored at the site or at another location agreed to by the County in writing, the Application for Payment will subdivide the work into component parts in sufficient detail to serve as the basis for a progress payment and shall also be accompanied by a bill of sale, invoice or other documentation warranting that upon payment by County, the County shall receive the materials and equipment free and clear of all liens, charges, security interests and encumbrances, together with evidence that the materials and equipment are covered by appropriate property insurance and other arrangements to protect County's interest therein, all of which shall be subject to the County's prior written approval.\n\n4.4\n\nContractor shall submit one electronic copy of each of its Applications for Payment to the County on or about the 25th day of each month for work performed during that month. Contractor shall submit no more than one application for payment each month. Within ten (10) calendar days after receipt of each Application for Payment, the County shall either:\n\n(1)\n\nindicate approval of the requested payment; (2) indicate approval of only a portion of the requested payment, stating in writing the reasons therefore; or (3) return the Application for Payment to the Contractor indicating, in writing, the reason for refusing to approve payment. In the event of a total or partial denial of the Application for Payment by the County, the Contractor may make the necessary corrections and resubmit the Application for Payment for reconsideration within ten (10) calendar days of receiving notice of refusal.\n\nIf re-submittal of the Application for Payment is refused, in whole or in part, the Contractor may submit a written request to the County Administrator for an administrative decision within two (2) business days of receiving notice of refusal. Upon receiving a timely request, an administrative decision shall be rendered within ten (10) calendar days with written notification provided to the Contractor.\n\nIf the administrative decision is disputed, the Contractor may submit a written request to the County Administrator for an administrative hearing before the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) within two (2) business days of receiving said decision. A hearing shall be scheduled within ten (10) business days from the date the request is received, and the Contractor will receive written notice of the hearing date. The DRC may, within its discretion, render a final decision at the hearing or may elect to mail a written decision within a period not to exceed ten (10) calendar days from the hearing date. The DRC's written decision shall be considered administratively final.\n\nThe County shall, within twenty (20) business days after County approval of an Application for Payment, pay the Contractor the amounts so approved. Provided, however, in no event shall the County be obligated to pay an amount greater than that portion of the Application for Payment approved by the County.\n\n4.5\n\nCounty shall retain ten percent (10%) of the gross amount of each monthly payment request or ten percent (10%) of the portion thereof approved by the County for payment whichever is less. The retained sum shall be accumulated and not released to Contractor until final payment is due. Any interim interest on such sums shall accrue to County.\n\nDue to circumstances beyond the Contractor's control and at the County's sole discretion, a percentage of the amount retained from the gross amount of each\n\nmonthly payment may be reduced prior to final completion of the Project and said percentage released to the Contractor upon receiving a certificate of substantial completion and approval from the Architect/Engineer. Release of any portion or percentage of sums retained prior to final completion of the Project shall in no way imply approval or acceptance of Contractor's work.\n\n4.6\n\nMonthly payments to Contractor shall in no way imply approval or acceptance of Contractor's work.\n\n4.7\n\nEach Application for Payment shall be accompanied by Release and Affidavit, in the form attached as Exhibit D, showing that all materials, labor, equipment and other bills associated with that portion of the Work payment is being requested or have been paid in full. The County shall not be required to make payment until and unless these affidavits are furnished by Contractor.\n\n4.8\n\nApplications for Payment will not be approved unless all submittals required by the Contract documents, up to that point, are provided and \"As-Built\" record documents are maintained as required by Section 8.2.\n\nSection 5. PAYMENTS WITHHELD\n\n5.1.\n\nThe County may decline to approve any Application for Payment, or portions thereof, because of subsequently discovered evidence or subsequent inspections. The County may nullify the whole or any part of any approval for payment previously issued and County may withhold any payments otherwise due Contractor under this Agreement or any other agreement between County and Contractor, to such extent as may be necessary in the County's opinion to protect it from loss because of: (a) defective Work not remedied; (b) third party claims filed or reasonable evidence indicating probable filing of such claims; (c) failure of Contractor to make payment properly to subcontractors or for labor, materials or equipment; (d) reasonable doubt that the Work can be completed for the unpaid balance of the Contract Amount; (e) reasonable indication that the Work will not be completed within the Contract Time; (f) unsatisfactory prosecution of the Work by the Contractor; or (g) any other material breach of the Contract Documents. If these conditions are not remedied or removed, County may, after three (3) days written notice, rectify the same at Contractor's expense. County also may offset against any sums due Contractor the amount of any liquidated or unliquidated obligations of Contractor to County, whether relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other agreement between Contractor and County.\n\nSection 6. FINAL PAYMENT\n\n6.1.\n\nCounty shall make final payment to Contractor within forty- five (45) calendar days after the Work is finally inspected and accepted by County in accordance with Section 20.1 herein, provided that Contractor first, and as an explicit condition precedent to the accrual of Contractor's right to final payment, shall have furnished County with a properly executed and notarized copy of the Release and Affidavit attached as Exhibit D, as well as, a duly executed copy of the Surety's consent to final payment and such other documentation that may be required by the Contract Documents or the County.\n\n6.2.\n\nContractor's acceptance of final payment shall constitute a full waiver of any and all claims by Contractor against County arising out of this Agreement or otherwise relating to the\n\nProject, except those previously made in writing and identified by Contractor as unsettled at the time of the final Application for Payment. Neither the acceptance of the Work nor payment by County shall be deemed to be a waiver of County's right to enforce any obligations of Contractor hereunder or to the recovery of damages for defective Work not discovered by the County at the time of final inspection.\n\nSection 7. SUBMITTALS AND SUBSTITUTIONS\n\n7.1.\n\nContractor shall carefully examine the Contract Documents for all requirements for approval of materials to be submitted such as shop drawings, data, test results, schedules and samples. When submitted for the Engineer's review, Shop Drawings shall bear the Contractor's certification that the Contractor has reviewed, checked, and approved the Shop Drawings and that they are in conformance with the requirements of the Contract Documents. Contractor shall submit all such materials at its own expense and in such form as required by the Contract Documents in sufficient time to prevent any delay in the delivery of such materials and the installation thereof.\n\n7.2.\n\nPrior to submitting its first Application for Payment, Contractor shall provide to County a CD/DVD in digital format and/or photographs (as determined by the County Project Manager) showing the pre-existing conditions located within the limits of construction.\n\n7.3.\n\nWhenever materials or equipment are specified or described in the Contract Documents by using the name of a proprietary item or the name of a particular supplier, the naming of the item is intended to establish the type, function and quality required. Unless the name is followed by words indicating that no substitution is permitted, materials or equipment of other suppliers may be accepted by County if sufficient information is submitted by Contractor to allow the County to determine that the material or equipment proposed is equivalent or equal to that named. Requests for review of substitute items of material and equipment will not be accepted by County from anyone other than Contractor and all such requests must be submitted by Contractor to County within thirty (30) calendar days after Notice to Proceed is received by Contractor.\n\n7.4.\n\nIf Contractor wishes to furnish or use a substitute item of material or equipment, Contractor shall make application to the County for acceptance thereof, certifying that the proposed substitute shall perform adequately the functions and achieve the results called for by the general design, be similar and of equal substance to that specified and be suited to the same use as that specified. The application shall state that the evaluation and acceptance of the proposed substitute will not prejudice Contractor's achievement of substantial completion on time, whether or not acceptance of the substitute for use in the Work will require a change in any of the Contract Documents (or in the provisions of any other direct contract with County for the Project) to adapt the design to the proposed substitute and whether or not incorporation or use by the substitute in connection with the Work is subject to payment of any license fee or royalty. All variations of the proposed substitute from that specified will be identified in the application and available maintenance, repair and replacement service shall be indicated. The application also shall contain an itemized estimate of all costs that will result directly or indirectly from acceptance of such substitute, including costs for redesign and claims of other contractors affected by the resulting change, all of which shall be considered by the County in evaluating the proposed substitute. The County may require Contractor to furnish at Contractor's expense additional data about the proposed substitute.\n\n7.5.\n\nIf a specific means, method, technique, sequence or procedure of construction is indicated in or required by the Contract Documents, Contractor may furnish or utilize a substitute means, method, sequence, technique or procedure of construction acceptable to the County, if Contractor submits sufficient information to allow the County to determine that the substitute proposed is equivalent to that indicated or required by the Contract Documents. The procedures for submission to and review by the County shall be the same as those provided herein for substitute materials and equipment.\n\n7.6.\n\nThe County shall be allowed a reasonable time within which to evaluate each proposed substitute. The County shall be the sole judge of acceptability, and no substitute will be ordered, installed or utilized without the County's prior written acceptance, which shall be evidenced by either a Change Order or an approved Shop Drawing. The County may require Contractor to furnish at Contractor's expense a special performance guarantee or other surety with respect to any substitute.\n\nSection 8. DAILY REPORTS, AS-BUILTS, AND MEETINGS\n\n8.1.\n\nUnless waived in writing by County, Contractor shall complete and submit, along with its Application for Payment, to the County on a monthly basis a daily log of the Contractor's work for the preceding month in a format approved by the County. The daily log shall document all activities of Contractor at the Project site including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n8.1.1.\n\nWeather conditions showing the high and low temperatures during work hours, the amount of precipitation received on the Project site, and any other weather conditions which adversely affect the Work;\n\n8.1.2.\n\nSoil conditions which adversely affect the Work;\n\n8.1.3.\n\nThe hours of operation by Contractor's personnel and subcontractor's personnel;\n\n8.1.4.\n\nThe number of Contractor's and subcontractor's personnel present and working at the Project site, by subcontract and trade;\n\n8.1.5.\n\nAll equipment present at the Project site, description of equipment use and designation of time equipment was used (specifically indicating any down time);\n\n8.1.6.\n\nDescription of Work being performed at the Project site;\n\n8.1.7.\n\nAny unusual or special occurrences at the Project site;\n\n8.1.8.\n\nMaterials received at the Project site\n\nThe daily log shall not constitute nor take the place of any notice required to be given by Contractor to County pursuant to the Contract Documents.\n\n8.2.\n\nContractor shall maintain in a safe place at the Project site one record copy of the Contract Documents, as well as all shop drawings and other Contractor submittals and all written interpretations and clarifications issued by the County, in good order and annotated to show\n\nall changes made during construction. The annotated drawings shall be continuously updated by the Contractor throughout the prosecution of the Work to accurately reflect all field changes that are made to adapt the Work to field conditions, changes resulting from Change Orders, Work Directive Changes and Field Orders, and all concealed and buried installations of piping, conduit and utility services. All buried and concealed items, both inside and outside the Project site, shall be accurately located on the annotated drawings as to depth and in relationship to not less than two (2) permanent features (e.g. interior or exterior wall faces). The annotated drawings shall be clean and all changes, corrections and dimensions shall be given in a neat and legible manner in a contrasting color. The \"As-Built\" record documents, together with all approved samples and a counterpart of all approved shop drawings shall be available to County for reference. Upon completion of the Work, and as a condition precedent to Contractor's entitlement to final payment, these \"As-Built\" record documents, samples and shop drawings shall be delivered to County by Contractor.\n\n8.3.\n\nContractor shall keep all records and supporting documentation which concern or relate to the Work hereunder for a minimum of five (5) years from the date of termination of this Agreement or the date the Project is completed, whichever is later. County, or any duly authorized agents or representatives of County, shall have the right to audit, inspect and copy all such records and documentation as often as they deem necessary during the period of this Agreement and during the five (5) year period noted above; provided, however, such activity shall be conducted only during normal business hours.\n\nSection 9. CONTRACT TIME AND TIME EXTENSIONS\n\n9.1.\n\nContractor shall diligently pursue the completion of the Work and coordinate the Work being done on the Project by its subcontractors and material men, as well as coordinating its Work with all work of others at the Project Site, so that its Work or the work of others shall not be delayed or impaired by any act or omission of Contractor. Contractor shall be solely responsible for all construction means, methods, techniques, sequences, and procedures, as well as coordination of all portions of the Work under the Contract Documents.\n\n9.2.\n\nShould Contractor be obstructed or delayed in the prosecution of or completion of the Work as a result of unforeseeable causes beyond the control of Contractor, and not due to its fault or neglect, including but not restricted to acts of God or of the public enemy, acts of government, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine regulations, strikes or lockouts, Contractor shall notify the County in writing within forty-eight (48) hours after the commencement of such delay. Written supporting data with specific details of Contractor operations, which were delayed, shall be submitted to the County within fifteen (15) calendar days after the occurrence of the delay, unless the County grants additional time in writing for such submittals, or else the Contractor shall be deemed to have waived any right which Contractor may have had to request a time extension.\n\n9.3.\n\nNo interruption, interference, inefficiency, suspension or delay in the commencement or progress of the Work from any cause whatever, including those for which County may be responsible, in whole or in part, shall relieve Contractor of his duty to perform or give rise to any right to damages or additional compensation from County. Contractor expressly acknowledges and agrees that it shall receive no damages for delay. Contractor's sole remedy, if any, against County will be the right to seek an extension to the Contract Time; provided, however, the granting of any such time extension shall not be a condition\n\nprecedent to the aforementioned \"No Damages For Delay\" provision. This paragraph shall expressly apply to claims for early completion, as well as to claims based on late completion.\n\n9.4.\n\nRequests for delays due to adverse weather conditions shall meet all of the following conditions:\n\n9.4.1.\n\nContractor notified the County in writing within forty-eight (48) hours of the delay.\n\n9.4.2.\n\nThe weather was unusual as documented by supporting data.\n\n9.4.3.\n\nThe weather did have an adverse impact on the contractor's schedule (critical path only).\n\n9.4.4.\n\nThe Contractor and inspector's daily logs corroborate the adverse impact. Where a conflict exists between the weather data and the daily reports, the daily reports will take precedence.\n\nSection 10. CHANGES IN THE WORK\n\n10.1.\n\nCounty shall have the right at any time during the progress of the Work to increase or decrease the Work. Promptly after being notified of a change, Contractor shall submit an itemized estimate of any cost and/or time increases or savings it foresees as a result of the change. Except in an emergency endangering life or property, or as expressly set forth herein, no addition or changes to the Work shall be made except upon written order of County, and County shall not be liable to the Contractor for any increased compensation without such written order. No officer, employee or agent of County is authorized to direct any extra or changed work orally.\n\n10.2.\n\nA Construction Change Order, in the form attached as Exhibit F to this Agreement, shall be issued and executed promptly after an agreement is reached between Contractor and County concerning the requested changes. Contractor shall promptly perform changes authorized by duly executed Change Orders. The Contract Amount shall be adjusted in the Change Order in the manner as County and Contractor shall mutually agree.\n\n10.3.\n\nIf County and Contractor are unable to agree on a Change Order for the requested change, Contractor shall, nevertheless, promptly perform the change as directed by County in a written Work Directive Change. In that event, the Contract Amount and Contract Time shall be adjusted as directed by County. If Contractor disagrees with the County's adjustment determination, Contractor must make a claim pursuant to Section 11 of these General Conditions or else be deemed to have waived any claim on this matter it might otherwise have had.\n\n10.4.\n\nIn the event a requested change results in an increase to the Contract Amount, the amount of the increase shall be limited to the Contractor's reasonable direct labor and material costs and reasonable actual equipment costs as a result of the change (including allowance for labor burden costs) plus a maximum ten percent (10%) markup for all overhead and profit. In the event such change Work is performed by a Subcontractor, a maximum ten percent (10%) markup for all overhead and profit for all Subcontractors' and sub-subcontractors' direct labor and material costs and actual equipment costs shall be\n\npermitted, with a maximum five percent (5%) markup thereon by the Contractor for all of its overhead and profit, for a total maximum markup of fifteen percent (15%). All compensation due Contractor and any Subcontractor or sub-subcontractor for field and home office overhead is included in the markups noted above.\n\n10.5.\n\nCounty shall have the right to conduct an audit of Contractor's books and records to verify the accuracy of the Contractor's claim with respect to Contractor's costs associated with any Change Order.\n\n10.6.\n\nThe County shall have authority to order minor changes in the Work not involving an adjustment to the Contract Amount and not inconsistent with the intent of the Contract Documents. Such changes may be affected by Field Order or by other written order. Such changes shall be binding on the Contractor.\n\nSection 11. CLAIMS AND DISPUTES\n\n11.1.\n\nA Claim is a demand or assertion by one of the parties seeking an adjustment or interpretation of the terms of the Contract Documents, payment of money, extension of time or other relief with respect to the terms of the Contract Documents.

OTHER WORK\n\n12.1.\n\nCounty may perform other work related to the Project at the site by County's own forces, have other work performed by utility owners or let other direct contracts. If the fact that such other work is to be performed is not noted in the Contract Documents, notice thereof will be given to Contractor. If Contractor believes that such performance will involve additional expense to Contractor or require additional time, Contractor shall send written notice of that fact with specific details of anticipated costs and delays to County within forty-eight (48) hours of being notified of the other work. Written supporting data of actual need for additional time or additional expense, shall be submitted to the County within fifteen (15) calendar days after completion of other work, unless the County grants additional time in writing, or else the Contractor shall be deemed to have waived any right which Contractor may have had to request a time extension or adjustment to the Contract Amount.\n\n12.2.\n\nContractor shall afford each utility owner and other contractor (or County, if County is performing the additional work with County's employees) proper and safe access to the site and a reasonable opportunity for the introduction and storage of materials and equipment and the execution of such work and shall properly connect and coordinate its Work with theirs.

Contractor's failure to report will constitute an acceptance of the other work as fit and proper for integration with Contractor's Work.\n\nSection 13. INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE\n\n13.1.\n\nContractor shall pay on behalf of or indemnify and hold harmless County and its agents, officers and employees from and against all liabilities, damages, losses, and costs, including attorney's and paralegal fees, incurred by County to the extent caused by the negligence, recklessness, or intentional wrongful misconduct of Contractor or by any person, firm or corporation to whom any portion of the Work is subcontracted by Contractor or resulting from the use by Contractor, or by anyone for whom Contractor is legally liable, of any materials, tools, machinery or other property of County. Contractor's obligation as provided herein shall be limited to its proportionate share of liability to the extent caused by the negligence, recklessness or intentional wrongful misconduct of Contractor or by any person, firm or corporation to whom any portion of the Work is subcontracted by Contractor, and Contractor shall not be required to pay on behalf of or indemnify and hold harmless County where County's negligence, recklessness, or intentional wrongful misconduct is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be the sole cause of its liabilities, damages, losses and costs, including attorney's fees and paralegal fees.\n\nCounty and Contractor agree one percent (1%) of the Contract Amount paid by County to Contractor shall be given as separate consideration for this indemnification, and any other indemnification of County by Contractor provided for within the Contract Documents, the sufficiency of such separate consideration being acknowledged by Contractor by Contractor's acceptance and execution of the Agreement.\n\nContractor agrees that such indemnification by Contractor relating to any matter which is the subject of this Agreement shall extend throughout the term of this Agreement and any applicable statutes of limitations thereafter.

The acceptance by County of any Certificate of Insurance does not constitute approval or agreement by the County that the insurance requirements have been satisfied or that the insurance policy shown on the Certificate of Insurance is in compliance with the requirements of the Contract Documents. No work shall commence at the Project site unless and until the required Certificates of Insurance are received by the County.\n\n13.5.\n\nContractor shall require each of its subcontractors to procure and maintain, until the completion of the subcontractor's work, insurance of the types and to the limits specified in Exhibit C, unless such insurance requirements for the subcontractor is expressly waived in writing by the County.

The County shall be under no obligation to purchase such insurance, nor shall it be responsible for the coverages purchased or the insurance company or companies used. The decision of the County to purchase such insurance coverages shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of any of its rights under the Contract Documents.\n\n13.8.\n\nContractor shall submit to County a copy of all accident reports arising out of any injuries to its employees or those of any firm or individual to whom it may have subcontracted a portion of the Work, or any personal injuries or property damages arising or alleged to have arisen on account of any work by Contractor under the Contract Documents.\n\n13.9.\n\nDuty to Provide Legal Defense.

Reasonable terminal expenses incurred by the County may be deducted from any payments left owing the Contractor (excluding monies owed the Contractor for subcontract work).\n\n19 TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE AND RIGHT OF SUSPENSION\n\n19.1\n\nCounty shall have the right to terminate this Agreement without cause upon seven (7) calendar days written notice to Contractor. In the event of such termination for convenience, Contractor's recovery against County shall be limited to that portion of the Contract Amount earned through the date of termination, together with any retainage withheld and reasonable termination expenses incurred, but Contractor shall not be entitled to any other or further recovery against County, including, but not limited to, damages or any anticipated profit on portions of the Work not performed.\n\n19.2\n\nCounty shall have the right to suspend all or any portions of the Work upon giving Contractor two (2) calendar days' prior written notice of such suspension. If all or any portion of the Work is so suspended, Contractor's sole and exclusive remedy shall be to seek an extension of time to its schedule in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Contract Documents. In no event shall the Contractor be entitled to any additional compensation or damages. Provided, however, if the ordered suspension exceeds three (3) months, the Contractor shall have the right to terminate the Agreement with respect to that portion of the Work which is subject to the ordered suspension.\n\n20 COMPLETION\n\n20.1\n\nUpon receipt of written notice, the County will ascertain whether the work or designated portions thereof are ready for the Engineer's substantial completion inspection. From the Engineer's list of incomplete or unsatisfactory items, a schedule for the County's review will be prepared for their completion indicating such completion dates. The County will issue a Certificate of Substantial Completion when the work on the punch list has been accomplished.\n\n20.2\n\nUpon receipt of written notice that the Work is ready for final inspection and acceptance and upon receipt of a final Application for Payment, the County shall promptly make such inspection and, if it finds the work acceptable and fully performed under the Contract Documents, shall promptly issue a Certificate of Final Completion and Recommendation for Payment, stating that, on the basis of observations and inspections, the Work has been completed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Contract Documents and that the entire balance found to be due the Contractor is due and payable. The final payment shall not become due and payable until Contractor submits: (1) the Release and Affidavit in the form attached as Exhibit D, (2) consent of surety to final payment, (3) if required by County, other data establishing payment or satisfaction of all obligations, such as receipts,\n\nreleases and waivers of liens, arising out of the Contract Documents, to the extent and in such form as may be designated by County, and (4) a published copy of the Notice of Completion as provided for in this section. County reserves the right to inspect the Work and make an independent determination as to the Work's acceptability. Unless and until the County is completely satisfied, the final payment shall not become due and payable.\n\n20.3\n\nAfter the Work is ready for final inspection and acceptance by the County, a legal advertisement must be published by the Contractor in a local newspaper of a general countywide circulation at least thirty (30) days before final payment shall be made. Example of such publication is as follows:\n\nLegal Notice of Completion\n\nNotice is hereby given that the undersigned Contractor has completed and has ready for acceptance by the Board of County Commissioners of Escambia County, Florida, the following construction project:\n\n__________________________________________________ (Project Name and Address)\n\n__________________________________________________ (Legal Name and Address - entity of the Contractor)\n\nSubcontractors, material men, and other persons having payment claims against the Contractor relating to this project should govern themselves accordingly.\n\n21 WARRANTY\n\n21.1\n\nContractor shall obtain and assign to County all express warranties given to Contractor or any subcontractors by any material men supplying materials, equipment or fixtures to be incorporated into the Project. Contractor warrants to County that any materials and equipment furnished under the Contract Documents shall be new unless otherwise specified, and that all Work shall be of good quality, free from all defects and in conformance with the Contract Documents. Contractor further warrants to County that all materials and equipment furnished under the Contract Documents shall be applied, installed, connected, erected, used, cleaned and conditioned in accordance with the instructions of the applicable manufacturers, fabricators, suppliers or processors except as otherwise provided for in the Contract Documents. If, within two (2) years after substantial completion and acceptance, any Work is found to be defective or not in conformance with the Contract Documents, Contractor shall correct it promptly after receipt of written notice from County. Contractor shall also be responsible for and pay for replacement or repair of adjacent materials or Work, which may be damaged as a result of such replacement or repair. These warranties are in addition to those implied warranties to which County is entitled as a matter of law. The Performance Bond, if required, shall remain in full force and effect throughout the two (2) year Warranty Period.\n\n22 PROJECT LAYOUT AND CONTROL\n\n22.1\n\nEngineer will provide survey control, referencing beginning and ending stations, P.C.'s, P.T.'s and intermediate stations at 500 foot intervals. Staking is to be set along control line (base line or centerline of right-of-way, as indicated on plans) or at an offset determined by the Engineer. Bench Marks will be provided at intervals no greater than 1000 feet. The Engineer at the Contractor's expense shall replace any of these points, which are disturbed or destroyed by the Contractor.\n\n22.2\n\nContractor shall employ a competent Engineer or Land Surveyor licensed in the State of Florida familiar with construction control procedures to lay out all other parts of the work, and to establish all points, grades and levels necessary to locate the work. The Contractor shall be held responsible for all mistakes that may be caused by his incorrect layout and grade spotting work, or caused by the loss or disturbance of the Engineer's layout work.\n\n22.3\n\nShould the Contractor in the course of the work find that the points, grades, and levels which are shown upon the Drawings are not conformable to the physical conditions of the locality at the proposed work or structure, he shall immediately inform the Engineer of the discrepancy between the actual physical conditions of the locality of the proposed work, and the points, grades and levels which are shown on the Drawings. No claim shall be made by the Contractor against the Owner for compensation or damage by reasons for failure of the Engineer to represent upon said Drawings, points, grades and levels conformable to the actual physical conditions of the locality of the proposed work.\n\n23 TESTS AND INSPECTIONS\n\n23.1\n\nCounty, its respective representatives, agents and employees, and any governmental agencies with jurisdiction over the Project shall have access at all times to the Work, whether the Work is being performed on or off of the Project site, for their observation, inspection and testing. Contractor shall provide proper, safe conditions for such access. Contractor shall provide County with timely notice of readiness of the Work for all required inspections, tests or approvals.\n\n23.2\n\nIf the Contract Documents or any codes, laws, ordinances, rules or regulations of any public authority having jurisdiction over the Project requires any portion of the Work to be specifically inspected, tested or approved, Contractor shall assume full responsibility therefore, pay all costs in connection therewith and furnish County the required certificates of inspection, testing or approval. All inspections, tests or approvals shall be performed in a manner and by organizations acceptable to the County.\n\n23.3\n\nIf any Work that is to be inspected, tested or approved is covered without written concurrence from the County, such work must, if requested by County, be uncovered for observation. Such uncovering shall be at Contractor's expense unless Contractor has given County timely notice of Contractor's intention to cover the same and County has not acted with reasonable promptness to respond to such notice. If any Work is covered contrary to written directions from County, such Work must, if requested by County, be uncovered for County's observation and be replaced at Contractor's sole expense.\n\n23.4\n\nNeither observations by the County nor inspections, tests or approvals by others shall relieve Contractor from Contractor's obligations to perform the Work in accordance with the\n\nContract Documents.\n\n23.5\n\nPrior to payment for any Work for which testing is specified, Contractor shall provide the County a copy of reasonably acceptable test results relating to such work as required by the technical specifications of the solicitation.\n\n24 DEFECTIVE WORK\n\n24.1\n\nWork not conforming to the requirements of the Contract Documents shall be deemed defective Work. If required by County, Contractor shall as directed, either correct all defective Work, whether or not fabricated, installed or completed, or, if the defective Work has been rejected by County, remove it from the site and replace it with acceptable Work. Contractor shall bear all direct, indirect and consequential costs of such correction or removal (including, but not limited to fees and charges of engineers, architects, attorneys and other professionals) made necessary thereby, and shall hold County harmless for same.\n\n24.2\n\nIf the County considers it necessary or advisable that covered Work be observed by County or inspected or tested by others, Contractor, at County's request, shall uncover, expose or otherwise make available for observation, inspection or tests as County may require, that portion of the Work in question, furnishing all necessary labor, material and equipment. If it is found that such Work is defective, Contractor shall bear all direct, indirect and consequential costs of such uncovering, exposure, observation, inspection and testing and of satisfactory reconstruction (including, but not limited to, fees and charges of engineers, architects, attorneys and other professionals), and County shall be entitled to an appropriate decrease in the Contract Amount. If, however, such Work is not found to be defective, Contractor shall be allowed an increase in the Contract Amount and/or an extension of the Contract Time, directly attributable to such uncovering, exposure, observation, inspection, testing and reconstruction.\n\n24.3\n\nIf any portion of the Work is defective, or Contractor fails to supply sufficient skilled workers with suitable materials or equipment, or fails to finish or perform the Work in such a way that the completed Work will conform to the Contract Documents, County may order Contractor to stop the Work, or any portion thereof, until the cause for such order has been eliminated; however, this right of County to stop the Work shall not give rise to any duty on the part of County to exercise this right for the benefit of Contractor or any other party.\n\n24.4\n\nShould the County determine, at its sole opinion, it is in the County's best interest to accept defective Work, the County may do so. Contractor shall bear all direct, indirect and consequential costs attributable to the County's evaluation of and determination to accept defective Work. If such determination is rendered prior to final payment, a Change Order shall be executed evidencing such acceptance of such defective Work, incorporating the necessary revisions in the Contract Documents and reflecting an appropriate decrease in the Contract Amount. If the County accepts such defective Work after final payment, Contractor at the discretion of the County shall promptly pay County an appropriate amount to adequately compensate County for its acceptance of the defective Work or shall increase in the Work's warranty period beyond two (2) years.\n\n24.5\n\nIf Contractor fails, within a reasonable time after the written notice from County, to correct defective Work or to remove and replace rejected defective Work as required by County, or\n\nif Contractor fails to perform the Work in accordance with the Contract Documents, or if Contractor fails to comply with any of the provisions of the Contract Documents, County may, after seven (7) days' written notice to Contractor, correct and remedy any such deficiency. To the extent necessary to complete corrective and remedial action, County may exclude Contractor from any or all of the Project site, take possession of all or any part of the Work, and suspend Contractor's services related thereto, take possessions of Contractor's tools, appliances, construction equipment and machinery at the Project site and incorporate in the Work all materials and equipment stored at the Project site or for which County has paid Contractor but which are stored elsewhere. Contractor shall allow County, and their respective representatives, agents, and employees such access to the Project site as may be necessary to enable County to exercise the rights and remedies under this Subsection. All direct, indirect and consequential costs of County in exercising such rights and remedies shall be charged against Contractor, and a Change Order shall be issued, incorporating the necessary revisions to the Contract Documents, including an appropriate decrease to the Contract Amount. Such direct, indirect and consequential costs shall include, but not be limited to, fees and charges of engineers, architects, attorneys and other professionals, all court and arbitration costs and all costs of repair and replacement of work or others destroyed or damaged by correction, removal or replacement of Contractor's defective Work. Contractor shall not be allowed an extension of the Contract Time because of any delay in performance of the Work attributable to the exercise by County of County's rights and remedies hereunder.\n\n25 SUPERVISION AND SUPERINTENDENTS\n\n25.1\n\nContractor shall supervise and direct the Work competently and efficiently, devoting such attention thereto and applying such skills and expertise as may be necessary to perform the Work in accordance with the Contract Documents. Contractor shall be responsible to see that the finished Work complies accurately with the Contract Documents. Contractor shall keep on the Work at all times during its progress a competent resident superintendent acceptable to the County, who shall not be replaced without prior written notice to County except under extraordinary circumstances. The resident superintendent shall possess Florida Department of Transportation approved training and certifications applicable to the Work, including but not limited to National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Stormwater Management and Maintenance of Traffic Control Devices. The superintendent shall be Contractor's representative at the Project site and shall have authority to act on behalf of Contractor. All communications given to the superintendent shall be as binding as if given to the Contractor. County shall have the right to direct Contractor to remove and replace its Project superintendent, with or without cause.\n\n26 PROTECTION OF WORK\n\n26.1\n\nContractor shall fully protect the Work from loss or damage and shall bear the cost of any such loss or damage until final payment has been made. If Contractor, or any one for whom Contractor is legally liable, is responsible for any loss or damage to the Work, or other work or materials of County or County's separate contractors, Contractor shall be charged with the same, and any monies necessary to replace such loss or damage shall be deducted from any amounts due Contractor.\n\n26.2\n\nContractor shall not load nor permit any part of any structure to be loaded in any manner that will endanger the structure, nor shall Contractor subject any part of the Work or\n\nadjacent property to stresses or pressures that will endanger it.\n\n27 EMERGENCIES\n\n27.1\n\nIn the event of an emergency affecting the safety or protection of persons or the Work or property at the Project site or adjacent thereto, Contractor, without special instruction or authorization from County is obligated to act to prevent threatened damage, injury or loss. Contractor shall give County written notice within forty-eight (48) hours after the occurrence of the emergency, if Contractor believes that any significant changes in the Work or variations from the Contract Document have been caused thereby. If the County determines that a change in the Contract Documents is required because of the action taken in response to an emergency, a Change Order shall be issued to document the consequences of the changes or variations. If Contractor fails to provide the forty-eight (48) hour written notice noted above, the Contractor shall be deemed to have waived any right it otherwise may have had to seek an adjustment to the Contract Amount or an extension to the Contract Time.\n\n28 USE OF PREMISES\n\n28.1\n\nContractor shall confine all construction equipment, the storage of materials and equipment and the operations of workers to the Project site and land and areas identified in and permitted by the Contract Documents and other lands and areas permitted by law, rights of way, permits and easements, and shall not unreasonably encumber the Project site with construction equipment or other material or equipment. Contractor shall assume full responsibility for any damage to any such land or area, or to the owner or occupant thereof, or any land or areas contiguous thereto, resulting from the performance of the Work.\n\n28.2\n\nContractor shall provide and maintain in a neat, sanitary condition such accommodation for the use of his employees as may be necessary to comply with the regulations of the State Board of Health or other bodies having jurisdiction. He shall commit no public nuisance.\n\n29 SAFETY\n\n29.1\n\nThe Contractor shall designate in writing the individual responsible for initiating, maintaining and supervising all safety precautions and programs in connection with the Work. The Contractor shall take all necessary precautions for the safety of, and shall provide the necessary protection to prevent damage, injury or loss to:\n\n29.1.1\n\nAll employees of the Work and other persons and/or organizations who may be affected thereby;\n\n29.1.2\n\nAll the Work and materials and equipment to be incorporated therein, whether in storage on or off the Project site; and\n\n29.1.3\n\nOther property on Project site or adjacent thereto, including trees, shrubs, lawns, walks, pavements, roadways, structures, utilities and any underground structures or improvements not designated for removal, relocation or replacement in the contract documents.\n\n29.2\n\nThe Contractor shall comply with all applicable codes, laws, ordinances, rules and\n\nregulations of any public body having jurisdiction for the safety of persons or property or to protect them from damage, injury or loss. The Contractor shall erect and maintain all necessary safeguards for such safety and protection. The Contractor shall notify owners of adjacent property and of underground structures and improvements and utility owners when prosecution of the Work may affect them, and shall cooperate with them in the protection, removal, relocation or replacement of their property. Contractor's duties and responsibilities for the safety and protection of the Work shall continue until such time as the Work is completed and final acceptance of same by County has occurred.\n\n29.3\n\nThe Contractor shall adhere at all times to the minimum safety guidelines for construction and renovation projects as set out in Exhibit C of this Agreement.\n\n30 PROJECT MEETINGS\n\n30.1\n\nPrior to the commencement of Work, the Contractor shall attend a pre-construction conference with the County to discuss the Progress Schedule, procedures for handling shop drawings and other submittals, and for processing Applications for Payment, and to establish a working understanding among the parties as to the Work. During the prosecution of the Work, the Contractor shall attend any and all meetings convened by the County with respect to the Project, when directed to do so by County. Contractor shall have its subcontractors and suppliers attend all such meetings (including the pre-construction conference) as may be directed by the County.\n\nEXHIBIT B PERFORMANCE AND PAYMENT BOND\n\nBOND NO. __________\n\nPERFORMANCE BOND\n\nKNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS: That_______________________________________________(Insert name, address, and phone number of contractor) ____________________________________________________________, as Principal, and\n\n______________________________________________________________________________ _________, (Insert full name, home office address and phone number of surety) as Surety, are held and firmly bound unto the Board of County Commissioners for Escambia County, Florida, 223 Palafox Place, Pensacola, Florida 32597-1591, (850) 595-4900, as Obligee in the sum of ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________ Dollars ($__________), for the payment whereof we bind ourselves, our heirs, executors, personal representatives, successors and assigns, jointly and severally, firmly by these presents.\n\nWHEREAS,\n\nPrincipal has entered into a contract dated as of the _____ day of__________, 20____, with Obligee for Contract No. ________, _____________________________________________________ (Insert name of project, including legal description, street address of property ______________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________ and general description of improvement) _______________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________in accordance with drawings and specifications, which contract is by reference made a part hereof, and is hereinafter referred to as the Contract.\n\nTHE CONDITION OF THIS BOND is that if Principal:\n\n1.\n\nPerforms the Contract at the times and in the manner prescribed in the Contract; and\n\n2.\n\nPays Obligee any and all losses, damages, costs and attorneys' fees that Obligee sustains because of any default by Principal under the Contract; and\n\n3.\n\nPerforms the guarantee of all work and materials furnished under the Contract applicable to the work and materials, then this bond is void; otherwise it remains in full force.\n\nThe Surety, for value received, hereby stipulates and agrees that no changes, extensions of time, alterations or additions to the terms of the Contract or other work to be performed hereunder, or the specifications referred to therein shall in anywise affect its obligation under this bond, and it does hereby waive notice of any such changes, extensions of time, alterations or additions to the terms of the Contract or to work or to the specifications.\n\nThis instrument shall be construed in all respects as a common law bond.\n\nIn no event will the Surety be liable in the aggregate to Obligee for more than the penalty sum of this Performance Bond, regardless of the number of suits that may be filed by Obligee.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the above parties have executed this instrument this _____ day of __________________________, 20____, the name and corporate seal of each corporate party being hereto affixed and these premises duly signed by its undersigned representative, pursuant to authority of its governing body.\n\nSigned, sealed and delivered in the presence of: PRINCIPAL:\n\n__________________________________________\n\nBy:_________________________________________\n\nName:_______________________________________\n\nIts:_________________________________________\n\nWitnesses as to Principal\n\nSTATE OF ____________________ COUNTY OF __________________\n\nThe foregoing instrument was acknowledged before me this _____ day of ____________________, 20 , by _____________________________, as __________________, of _________________________________, a ________________ corporation, on behalf of the corporation.

The Contractor is responsible for the amount of any deductible or self-insured retention.\n\nInsurance required of the Contractor or any other insurance of the Contractor shall be considered primary, and insurance of the County, if any, shall be considered excess, as may be applicable to claims obligations which arise out of this agreement, contract or lease.\n\nWorkers Compensation Coverage\n\nThe Contractor shall purchase and maintain workers compensation insurance for all workers compensation obligations imposed by state law and with employers liability limits of at least $100,000 each accident and $100,000 each employee/$500,000 policy limit for disease, or a valid certificate of exemption issued by the state of Florida, or an affidavit in accordance with the provisions of Florida Workers Compensation law.\n\nContractor shall also purchase any other coverages required by law for the benefit of employees.\n\nGeneral, Automobile And Excess Or Umbrella Liability Coverage\n\nThe Contractor shall purchase and maintain coverage on forms no more restrictive than the latest editions of the Commercial General Liability and Business Auto policies of the Insurance Services Office.\n\nMinimum limits of $1,000,000 per occurrence for all liability must be provided, with excess or umbrella insurance making up the difference, if any, between the policy limits of underlying policies (including employers liability required in the Workers Compensation Coverage section) and the total amount of coverage required.\n\nGeneral Liability Coverage - Occurrence Form Required\n\nCoverage A shall include bodily injury and property damage liability for premises, operations, products and completed operations, independent contractors, contractual liability covering this agreement, contract or lease, broad form property damage coverages, and property damage resulting from explosion, collapse or underground (x,c,u) exposures.\n\nCoverage B shall include personal injury.\n\nCoverage C, medical payments, is not required.\n\nThe Contractor is required to continue to purchase products and completed operations coverage, at least to satisfy this agreement, contract or lease, for a minimum of three years beyond the County's acceptance of renovation or construction projects.\n\nBusiness Auto Liability Coverage\n\nBusiness Auto Liability coverage is to include bodily injury and property damage arising out of ownership, maintenance or use of any auto, including owned, nonowned and hired automobiles and employee nonownership use.\n\nExcess or Umbrella Liability Coverage\n\nUmbrella Liability insurance is preferred, but an Excess Liability equivalent may be allowed. Whichever type of coverage is provided, it shall not be more restrictive than the underlying insurance policy coverages. Umbrella coverage shall drop down to provide coverage where the underlying limits are exhausted.\n\nWATERCRAFT LIABILITY COVERAGE\n\nBecause the Contractor's provision of services involves utilization of watercraft, watercraft liability coverage must be provided with $1,000,000 per occurrence minimum limit to include bodily injury and property damage arising out of ownership, maintenance or use of any watercraft, including owned, nonowned and hired. Coverage may be provided in the form of an endorsement to the general liability policy, or in the form of a separate policy covering Watercraft Liability or Protection and Indemnity.\n\nPOLLUTION/ENVIRONMENTAL IMPAIRMENT LIABILITY COVERAGE\n\nAt the County's discretion, Contractor may be required to purchase and maintain pollution/environmental impairment liability insurance with $1,000,000 per occurrence minimum limit to cover pollution and/or environmental impairment which may arise from this agreement or contract.\n\nEvidence/Certificates of Insurance\n\nRequired insurance shall be documented in Certificates of Insurance. If and when required by the County, Certificates of Insurance shall be accompanied by documentation that is acceptable to the County establishing that the insurance agent and/or agency issuing the Certificate of Insurance has been duly authorized, in writing, to do so by and on behalf of each insurance company underwriting the insurance coverages(s) indicated on each Certificate of Insurance.\n\nNew Certificates of Insurance are to be provided to the County at least 30 days prior to coverage renewals. Failure of the Contractor to provide the County with such renewal certificates may be considered justification for the County to terminate this agreement, contract or lease.\n\nCertificates should contain the following additional information.\n\n1.\n\nIndicate that Escambia County is an additional insured on the general liability policy.\n\n2.\n\nInclude a reference to the project and the Office of Purchasing number.\n\n3.\n\nDisclose any self-insured retentions in excess of $1,000.\n\n4.\n\nDesignate Escambia County as the certificate holder as follows: Escambia County\n\nAttention: _________________________ Office of Purchasing\n\nP.O. Box 1591 Pensacola, FL 32597-1591 Fax (850) 595-4805\n\n5.\n\nIndicate that the County shall be notified at least 30 days in advance of cancellation.\n\nReceipt of certificates or other documentation of insurance or policies or copies of policies by the County, or by any of its representatives, which indicate less coverage than required does not constitute a waiver of the Contractor's obligation to fulfill the insurance\n\nrequirements herein.\n\nIf requested by the County, the Contractor shall furnish complete copies of the Contractor's insurance policies, forms and endorsements, and/or such additional information with respect to its insurance as may be requested.\n\nFor Commercial General Liability coverage the Contractor shall, at the option of the County, provide an indication of the amount of claims payments or reserves chargeable to the aggregate amount of liability coverage.\n\nENDORSEMENTS/ADDITIONAL INSURANCE\n\nIf checked below, the County requires the following endorsements or additional types of insurance.\n\n__\n\nTERMINATION/ADVERSE CHANGE ENDORSEMENT\n\nAll of Contractor's policies, except for professional liability and workers compensation insurance, are to be endorsed, and the Contractor's Certificate(s) of Insurance shall state, that the County shall be notified at least 30 days in advance of cancellation, nonrenewal or adverse change.\n\n__\n\nPROPERTY COVERAGE FOR LEASES\n\nThe Contractor shall procure and maintain for the life of the lease, all risk/special perils (including sinkhole) property insurance (or its equivalent) to cover loss resulting from damage to or destruction of the building and personal property/contents.

If the general liability insurance covers liquor liability (e.g. host or other coverage), the Contractor's agent or insurer should provide written documentation to confirm that coverage already applies to this agreement, contract or lease. If needed coverage is not included in the general/umbrella/excess liability policy(ies), the policy(ies) must be endorsed to extend coverage for liquor liability, or a separate policy must be purchased to provide liquor liability coverage in the\n\namount required.\n\n__\n\nOWNERS PROTECTIVE LIABILITY COVERAGE\n\nFor renovation or construction contracts the Contractor shall provide for the County an owners protective liability insurance policy (preferably through the Contractor's insurer) in the name of the County.\n\nThis is redundant coverage if the County is named as an additional insured in the Contractor's Commercial General Liability insurance policy. However, this separate policy may be the only source of coverage if the Contractor's liability coverage limit is used up by other claims.\n\n__\n\nBUILDERS RISK COVERAGE\n\nBuilders Risk insurance is to be purchased to cover subject property for all risks of loss, subject to a waiver of coinsurance, and covering off-site storage, transit and installation risks as indicated in the Installation Floater and Motor Truck Cargo insurance described hereafter, if such coverages are not separately provided.\n\nThe Builders Risk insurance is to be endorsed to cover the interests of all parties, including the County and all contractors and subcontractors. The insurance is to be endorsed to grant permission to occupy.\n\n__\n\nINSTALLATION FLOATER COVERAGE\n\nInstallation Floater insurance is to be purchased when Builder's Risk insurance is inappropriate, or when Builder's Risk insurance will not respond, to cover damage or destruction to renovations, repairs or equipment being installed or otherwise being handled or stored by the Contractor, including off-site storage, transit and installation. The amount of coverage should be adequate to provide full replacement value of the property, repairs, additions or equipment being installed, otherwise being handled or stored on or off premises. All risks coverage is preferred.\n\n__\n\nMOTOR TRUCK CARGO COVERAGE\n\nIf the Installation Floater insurance does not provide transportation coverage, separate Motor Truck Cargo or Transportation insurance is to be provided for materials or equipment transported in the Contractor's or other vehicles from place of receipt to building sites or other storage sites.

The limits of liability applicable to the SERP coverage shall be equal to the limits of liability applicable to the policy referenced above and to which the endorsement attaches.\n\nMINIMUM PROJECT SAFETY REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe following safety requirements represent the minimum conditions which shall be met by all Contractors and subcontractors performing work for Escambia County. The Contractor shall be responsible to ensure his compliance with all State and Federal safety regulations as specified in County contract documents. Reported or observed violations of OSHA (29 CFR 1910 or 1926) and other regulations shall be brought to the attention of the County project manager and County Safety Office and shall be immediately corrected by the Contractor. Failure to comply with required safety procedures shall result in the suspension of the Work of the Contractor until such time as his operations are brought into compliance. Items which are not corrected or that are disputed by the Contractor may be referred by the County to either the project insurance coordinator or the Department of Labor and Employment Security, Division of Safety, for inspection or interpretation. The Contractor shall take reasonable precautions for work place safety and shall provide reasonable protection to prevent damage, injury, or loss to employees on the work site and to other persons who may be affected by the Work.\n\n(1)\n\nPrior to the commencement of the project, the Contractor and all subcontractors shall provide to the County a written copy of their respective safety and health plans for review as part of the pre-submittal bid package.\n\n(2)\n\nThe Contractor shall establish and maintain an access control system at the work site, including a daily sign-in log, for all visitors, including County and regulatory personnel. Prior to commencement of construction, the project manager may designate specific individuals for routine access so that their duties are not impeded. All visitors that are not pre-approved for admittance shall be escorted through the project by either a Contractor representative or by the project manager or designee.\n\n(3)\n\nThe Contractor shall provide all necessary safety equipment for County staff, employees, and visitors to enter the work site. This equipment may include hard hats, hearing protection, safety glasses, or any other safety items deemed necessary by the Contractor or required by State or Federal safety regulations.\n\n(4)\n\nConstruction vehicles on the work site shall always be operated in a safe manner. The Contractor shall take appropriate action to ensure the safety of County staff, visitors, and the general public while operating work vehicles at a controlled construction site. Where conditions warrant, or at the request of the County, temporary barriers shall also be established for these traffic areas.\n\n(5)\n\nThe Contractor shall prominently mark the work site and ensure its security. Site security shall include appropriate fencing, barricades, warning tape, covered walkways and warning signs. In no instance shall a work site be accessible, without obvious warning, to County staff, visitors, or the general public. At a minimum, the project site shall be posted with the\n\nappropriate trespass warning signs as specified in Section 810.09(2)(d), Florida Statutes: THIS AREA IS A DESIGNATED CONSTRUCTION SITE; ANYONE TRESPASSING ON THIS PROPERTY SHALL, UPON CONVICTION, BE GUILTY OF A FELONY; DANGER, CONSTRUCTION SITE. AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY, and other general safety warning signs, i.e., HARD HAT AREA, as are deemed necessary by the Contractor and project manager.\n\n(6)\n\nIn the event barricading of a work site is not feasible, alternative measures may be used upon prior approval by the County safety Office. Alternative measures may include, but are not limited to, working during off hours such as nights, weekends, or holidays, or the providing of temporary accommodations for building occupants (to be prearranged, if necessary, at the discretion of the County).\n\n(7)\n\nThe Contractor shall ensure compliance with all fire safety codes at the work site, especially as to egress, during the construction phase of an occupied facility. In no instance, (except where impractical and with the prior approval of the County Safety Office and the appropriate life safety code inspector), shall the life safety code components of an occupied facility be reduced or otherwise compromised. A set of these construction plans, with a signature of approval by the appropriate life safety code inspector, shall be kept at each construction site and available for routine inspection. The Contractor shall communicate with each subcontractor as to scheduling of events that may pose hazards or inconveniences to building occupants. The Contractor shall also ensure that appropriate scheduling information is also conveyed to the project manager.\n\n(8)\n\nNoise, dust, and the use of chemical products may create inside health hazards at the work site to building occupants requiring that the Contractor to adhere to the following guidelines at a minimum:\n\n(a)\n\nThe Contractor shall initiate construction and engineering safety controls to minimize exposure of dusts, noise, and chemical odors to building occupants. These controls may involve the construction or use of temporary walls, plastic barriers, mechanical ventilation, elimination of make-up air returns from work areas, pressurizing occupied areas, or a combination of several methods. The Contractor shall coordinate all such engineering efforts with the project manager, and these control measures shall require prior approval by the County Safety Office. In cases where these efforts may not be feasible, alternative work schedules on evenings and weekends may be instituted as a part of this process.\n\n(b)\n\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) shall be provided for all hazardous substances used on the project or brought on the job site. These products include, but are not limited to, paints, solvents, roofing compounds, and cleaning compounds.\n\n(c)\n\nAppropriate precautions shall be taken to prevent occupant exposure to hazardous respirable dusts, contaminants, and fumes from welding, cutting, or drilling of concrete and masonry, or the operation of internal combustion engines. The Contractor shall also determine whether respirable crystalline silica, which is a potential carcinogen contained in many building products, is present at the work site. Control of dusts from these types of products and operations shall be an essential safety requirement for the Contractor.\n\n(d)\n\nThe Contractor should be aware of other buildings adjacent to his work areas and shall be prepared to take necessary actions to prevent the spread of dusts and fumes to those facilities.\n\n(9)\n\nThe Contractor shall ensure that all emergency notifications, including those for fires and medical needs, shall be promptly made by dialing County 911 dispatchers. The Caller should state the exact location of the work site emergency, the nature of the emergency, and specifically indicate if medical or fire services are needed.\n\n(10)\n\nThe Contractor agrees and understands that all County construction/renovation sites shall be subject to periodic inspection by life safety code inspectors, Florida Department of Labor and Employment Security, Division of Safety, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Environmental Protection Agency, and other Federal, State, or County regulatory agencies.\n\n(11)\n\nThe Contractor shall provide adequate refuse containers for the disposal of construction debris. Refuse shall not be allowed to accumulate on the project site grounds, and the Contractor shall ensure that these containers are subsequently emptied on a regular basis.\n\n(12)\n\nWater runoff and soil erosion from the project site shall be controlled by the Contractor pursuant to the regulations of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.\n\n(13)\n\nWater-based paint and stain products shall be used by the Contractor in the place of solvent-based products where the application so permits. Use of organic solvent-based products shall be used only where absolutely necessary and with the prior approval of the project manager. Lead-containing paints shall not be normally used or specified for any application. If the use of lead-containing paint is essential for a specific application, prior approval from the project manager or County Safety Office shall be obtained before their use.\n\n(14)\n\nThe use of any products containing toxic metals, especially those regulated by Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), (i.e. lead, chromium, barium, silver, arsenic, cadmium, mercury, selenium), on the work site shall be avoided.\n\nPrior approval for use of these metals shall be obtained by the Contractor from the project manager.\n\n(15)\n\nThe use of any radioactive materials by the Contractor on project sites shall require pre-approval. Copies of appropriate certifications, licenses, testing, and inspection records shall be provided by the Contractor to the project manager and County Safety Office for review.\n\n(16)\n\nThe County maintains programs for the identification and abatement of asbestos containing building materials. Asbestos abatement can only be performed by state licensed asbestos abatement contractors. General contractors, therefore, shall not be authorized to remove or disturb any asbestos containing materials. Although efforts are made to identify or remove such asbestos containing materials prior to renovations, the possibility exists that asbestos materials may be encountered at a work site. If so, Contractors who encounter such materials shall immediately stop work and notify the project manager or the County Safety Office.\n\n(17)\n\nThe above-cited guidelines represent minimum expectations and actions which shall be taken by Contractors while under contract for County construction and renovation projects. These guidelines are not all inclusive and will be revised as necessary. In the event these guidelines conflict with other contract documents, the most stringent application shall apply. Any questions or disputes should be brought to the immediate attention of the project manager or County Safety Office.\n\nEXHIBIT D\n\nRELEASE AND AFFIDAVIT\n\nCOUNTY OF ESCAMBIA ) )\n\nSTATE OF FLORIDA )\n\nBefore me, the undersigned authority, personally appeared _________________________, who after being duly sworn, deposes and says:\n\n(1)\n\nIn accordance with the Contract Documents and in consideration of $________________ paid, ______________________________________ (\"Contractor\") releases and waives for itself and its subcontractors, materialmen, successors and assigns, all claims demands, costs and expenses, whether in contract or in tort, against the Board of County Commissioners of Escambia County, Florida, (\"County\") relating in any way to the performance of the Agreement between Contractor and County dated ______________________, 20____, for the period from _____________________ to _____________________.\n\n(2)\n\nContractor certifies for itself and its subcontractors, materialmen, successors and assigns, that all charges for labor, materials, supplies, lands, licenses and other expenses for which County might be sued or for which a lien or a demand against any payment bond might be filed, have been fully satisfied and paid.\n\n(3)\n\nContractor agrees to indemnify, defend and save harmless County from all demands or suits, actions, claims of liens or other charges filed or asserted against the County arising out of the performance by Contractor of the Work covered by this Release and Affidavit.\n\n(4)\n\nThis Release and Affidavit is given in connection with Contractor's (monthly/final) Application for Payment No. _____.\n\nCONTRACTOR:\n\n__________________________________\n\nBy:__________________________________\n\nIts:_____________________________ President Date:________________________\n\n[Corporate Seal]\n\nSTATE OF FLORIDA\n\nCOUNTY OF ESCAMBIA\n\nThe foregoing instrument was acknowledged before me this _____ day of ____________________, 20___, by_____________________________, as _________________ of _____________________________________, a _________________ corporation, on behalf of the corporation.
