Contractor and the Water Authority acknowledge that the Internet is occasionally victimized by the creation and dissemination of so-called viruses, or similar destructive electronic programs. Contractor and the Water Authority view the issues raised by these viruses seriously and have invested in document and e-mail scanning software that identify and reject files containing known viruses. Contractor agrees to update its system with the software vendor's most current releases at regular intervals. Because of the virus scanning software, the respective computer systems of the parties may occasionally reject a communication. The parties acknowledge that this occurrence is to be expected as part of the ordinary course of business. Because the virus protection industry is generally one or two steps behind new viruses, neither party can guarantee that its respective communications and documents will be virus free. Occasionally, a virus will escape and go undetected as it is passed from system to system. Although each party will use all reasonable efforts to assure that its communications are virus free, neither party warrants that its documents will be virus free. Each party agrees to advise the other if it discovers a virus in its respective system that may have been communicated to the other party. </bbox></p></section><section data-level=\"2\" id=\"1.26\"><p text-alignment=\"left\"><bbox height=\"7.872000217437744\" page=\"12\" width=\"167.3399658203125\" x=\"72.0\" y=\"475.4276428222656\">26.

Whenever the scope of work requires or permits approval by the Water Authority, it is understood to be approval solely for the purposes of conforming to the requirements of the scope of work and not acceptance of any professional or other responsibility for the work. Such approval does not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for complying with the standard of performance or laws, regulations, industry standards, or from liability for damages caused by negligent acts, errors, omissions, noncompliance with industry standards, or the willful misconduct of Contractor or its subcontractors. By delivery of completed work, Contractor certifies that the work conforms to the requirements of this contract and all applicable federal,\n\nstate and local laws.

Contractor is responsible to the Water Authority for the acts and omissions of Contractor's subcontractors and of the subcontractor's employees in performance of this contract. Nothing contained in this contract shall create any contractual relationship between any subcontractor of Contractor and the Water Authority. Contractor shall pay subcontractors within ten (10) days of receipt of payment by Water Authority for work performed by a subcontractor and billed by the Contractor.\n\n(b)\n\nFailure by the Contractor to fulfill any of the SCOOP requirements constitutes breach of contract. The Water Authority may seek, without limitation, the following remedies:\n\n(1)\n\nWithholding progress payments until the Water Authority deems the Contractor to be in compliance.\n\n(2)\n\nWithholding an amount equal to the unmet portion of the amount contracted to the subcontractor, vendor, or supplier in question.\n\n(3)\n\nSuspension or debarment pursuant to the Water Authority's Administrative Code Chapter 4.12 Section 4.12.020.\n\n(4)\n\nTermination of the contract.\n\n[\n\nOption 2\n\n] Contractor will perform the work personally or through Contractor's employees.

The Water Authority shall not be required to pay any workers' compensation insurance on behalf of Contractor.\n\n(c)\n\nIndemnification for Employee Payments. Contractor agrees to defend and indemnify the Water Authority for any obligation, claim, suit or demand for tax, retirement contribution including any contribution to the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS), social security, salary or wages, overtime payment, or workers' compensation payment which the Water Authority may be required to make on behalf of Contractor or any employee of Contractor, or any employee of Contractor construed to be an employee of the Water Authority, for work done under this contract.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST:\n\n(a)\n\nLocal Conflict of Interest Code Compliance.[\n\nOPTION 1\n\n]: The Water Authority has determined, based on the scope of the services to be provided by Contractor under this contract, that this contract does not confer on Contractor or any of Contractor's employees the status of a \"designated employee\" or \"Consultant\" of the Water Authority for the purposes of the Water\n\nAuthority's Local Conflict of Interest Code and the California Political Reform Act. This contract does not require or permit Contractor to make a governmental decision as specified in 2 Cal. Code of Regs. \u00a7 18701, subdiv. (a)(2)(A), or serve in a staff capacity as specified in 2 Cal. Code of Regs. \u00a7 18701, subdiv. (a)(2)(B).\n\n[\n\nOPTION 2:\n\nThe Water Authority has determined, based on the scope of the services to be provided by Contractor under this contract, that this contract confers on Contractor or any of Contractor's employees the status of a \"designated employee\" or \"Consultant\" of the Water Authority for the purposes of the Water Authority's Local Conflict of Interest Code and the California Political Reform Act. Contractor will be subject to the same provisions as the _________ Designation in the Water Authority's Local Conflict of Interest Code.\n\n(b)\n\nDisqualification. Contractor shall not make or participate in making or in any way attempt to use Contractor's position to influence a governmental decision in which Contractor knows or has reason to know Contractor has a direct or indirect financial interest other than the compensation promised by this contract. Contractor will not have such interest during the term of this contract. Contractor will immediately advise the General Counsel of the Water Authority if Contractor learns of a financial interest of Contractor's during the term of this contract. If Contractor's participation in another Water Authority project would create an actual or potential conflict of interest, in the opinion of the Water Authority, the Water Authority may disqualify Contractor from participation in such other project during the term of this Contract.\n\n18. INDEMNIFICATION:\n\n(a)\n\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, the Contractor shall (1) immediately defend, and (2) indemnify the Water Authority, and its directors, officers, and employees from and against all liabilities regardless of nature or type arising out of or resulting from Contractor's performance of services under this contract, or any negligent or wrongful act or omission of the Contractor or Contractor's officers, employees, agents, or subcontractors. Liabilities subject to the duties to defend and indemnify include, without limitation all claims, losses, damages, penalties, fines, and judgments; associated investigation and administrative expenses; defense costs, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees; court costs; and costs of alternative dispute resolution. The Contractor's obligation to indemnify applies unless it is adjudicated that its liability was caused by the sole active negligence or sole willful misconduct of an indemnified party. If it is finally adjudicated that liability is caused by the comparative active negligence or willful misconduct of an indemnified party, the Contractor's indemnification obligation shall be reduced in proportion to the established comparative liability of the indemnified party.\n\n(b)\n\nThe duty to defend is a separate and distinct obligation from the Contractor's duty to indemnify. The Contractor shall be obligated to defend, in all legal, equitable, administrative, or special proceedings, with counsel approved by the Water Authority, the Water Authority and its directors, officers, and employees, immediately upon tender to the Contractor of the claim in any form or at any stage of an action or proceeding, whether or not liability is established. An allegation or determination of comparative active negligence or willful misconduct by an indemnified party does not relieve the Contractor from its separate and distinct obligation to\n\ndefend Water Authority. The obligation to defend extends through final judgment, including exhaustion of any appeals. The defense obligation includes an obligation to provide independent defense counsel if the Contractor asserts that liability is caused in whole or in part by the negligence or willful misconduct of the indemnified party. If it is finally adjudicated that liability was caused by the sole active negligence or sole willful misconduct of an indemnified party, Contractor may submit a claim to the Water Authority for reimbursement of reasonable attorneys' fees and defense costs.\n\n(c)\n\nThe review, acceptance or approval of the Contractor's work or work product by any indemnified party shall not affect, relieve or reduce the Contractor's indemnification or defense obligations. This Section survives completion of the services or the termination of this contract. The provisions of this Section are not limited by and do not affect the provisions of this contract relating to insurance.\n\n19. INSURANCE:\n\n(a)\n\nRequirement.

For breach or violation of this provision, the Water Authority shall have the right to terminate this contract without liability, or, in its discretion, to deduct from the contract price or consideration, or otherwise recover, the full amount of such fee, commission, percentage, brokerage fees, gift, or contingent fee.\n\n22. TERMINATION OR ABANDONMENT:\n\n(a)\n\nWater Authority's Rights. The Water Authority has the right to terminate or abandon any portion or all of the work by giving ten (10) days' written notice. Upon receipt of a notice of termination, Contractor shall perform no further work except as specified in the notice. Before the date of termination, Contractor shall deliver to Water Authority all work product, whether completed or not, as of the date of termination and not otherwise previously delivered. The Water Authority shall pay Contractor for services performed in accordance with this contract before the date of termination. If this contract provides for payment of a lump sum for all services or by task and termination occurs before completion of the work or any defined task which according to the performance schedule was commenced before the notice of termination, the fee for services performed shall be based on an amount mutually agreed to by the Water Authority and Contractor for the portion of work completed in conformance with this contract before the date of termination. In addition, the Water Authority will reimburse Contractor for authorized expenses incurred and not previously reimbursed. The Water Authority shall not be liable for any fees or costs associated for the termination or abandonment except for the fees, and reimbursement of authorized expenses, payable pursuant to this section.\n\n(b)\n\nContractor's Rights. Contractor, if Contractor is not in default or breach, may terminate Contractor's obligation to provide further services under this contract upon thirty (30) days' written notice only in the event of a material default by the Water Authority, which default has not been cured within thirty (30) days following the written notice.\n\n23. SUCCESSORS OR ASSIGNS:\n\nAll terms, conditions, and provisions of this contract shall apply to and bind the respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns of the parties. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to affect the limitation on assignment.\n\n24. DAMAGE OR LOSS OF EQUIPMENT OR FACILITIES:\n\n(a)\n\nGeneral Obligation. Contractor shall pay to the Water Authority the replacement cost of any equipment or repair cost of any facilities provided by the Water Authority for Contractor's use in performance of services that is lost or damaged by Contractor or Contractor's officers, employees, agents or subcontractors.\n\n(b)\n\nKeys. During the term of the contract, Contractor may be issued keys to Water Authority\n\nfacilities in order to perform the scope of work. Keys shall not be loaned, duplicated, or given to anyone not authorized to have the keys. Contractor will sign for each key and each key will be returned to the project manager when access to that area is no longer authorized, or at the end of the contract term, whichever is applicable. Should keys become lost or stolen, Contractor shall immediately notify the Contract Manager. A charge will be assessed for all expenses incurred by the Water Authority, including the replacement of locks, lock cores, keys, and other materials necessary to ensure the Water Authority security level is returned to the same level existing prior to the loss of the key(s). The cost of replacing locks may be as much as $40,000.\n\n25. ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS:\n\nDuring the course of this contract, communications may occur through sending, receiving or exchanging electronic versions of documents and e-mails using commercially available computer software and Internet access. Contractor and the Water Authority acknowledge that the Internet is occasionally victimized by the creation and dissemination of so-called viruses, or similar destructive electronic programs. Contractor and the Water Authority view the issues raised by these viruses seriously and have invested in document and e-mail scanning software that identify and reject files containing known viruses. Contractor agrees to update its system with the software vendor's most current releases at regular intervals. Because of the virus scanning software, the respective computer systems of the parties may occasionally reject a communication. The parties acknowledge that this occurrence is to be expected as part of the ordinary course of business. Because the virus protection industry is generally one or two steps behind new viruses, neither party can guarantee that its respective communications and documents will be virus free. Occasionally, a virus will escape and go undetected as it is passed from system to system. Although each party will use all reasonable efforts to assure that its communications are virus free, neither party warrants that its documents will be virus free. Each party agrees to advise the other if it discovers a virus in its respective system that may have been communicated to the other party.\n\n26. LAWS AND VENUE:\n\nThis contract and disputes arising out of or relating to the contract or the parties' relationship are governed by the laws of the State of California.
